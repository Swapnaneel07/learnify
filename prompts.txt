Create a modern online learning dashboard website called Learnify.ai. The platform should have a top navigation bar with logo, dashboard, subjects, settings, and user progress. A left sidebar for subjects with icons, a main section for assignments and notes with PDF-style viewer, and a right sidebar for AI Q&A and note-to-audio conversion. Use a dark-blue theme with rounded cards, soft shadows, and clean fonts. The site should feel professional, minimal, and student-friendly, with interactive features like assignment tracking, AI tutor responses, and audio playback for notes.
for the profile, add a drop down menu with profile, settings, log out, help etc. also it shows the user name when hovered over
Expand Learnify.ai into a full online learning platform. In addition to the dashboard, include:

A Subjects Page with subject cards showing progress and an option to add/remove subjects.
